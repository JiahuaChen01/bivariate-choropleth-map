Data Visualization Project: Obesity vs Fast Food Chains

This project focuses on the visualization of the relationship between obesity rates and the presence of fast food restaurant chains in various regions across the United States. Using d3.js, we crafted static visualizations that reveal patterns and trends in how fast food availability may correspond with obesity statistics.
